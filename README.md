# Dawtfyles

Time to join the not-so-special group of folks with their dotfiles on git (even though these repos usually don't hold dotfiles, and instead have dirs in `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}`).

## Structure

This repository installs itself using [stow](https://github.com/aspiers/stow/), targeting `~`.

## Should I use this?

Probably not.
